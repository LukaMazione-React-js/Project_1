# Personal CV Display App
## Overview
This project is a simple yet effective React application designed to display a personal Curriculum Vitae (CV) in a web format. Developed as my first project, it showcases basic skills in TypeScript, the use of JSX for templating, and the power of array mapping to render lists. The application presents personal details, a snapshot of professional experience, and educational background.

### Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For adding type safety to our React components and interfaces, ensuring a more robust and error-free development experience.
- **JSX**: Utilized within React components to describe the UI structure in a syntax similar to HTML, but with the power of JavaScript.
- **React**: Leveraged for its component-based architecture, enabling efficient updates and rendering of personal CV data.
- **SCSS**: For styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing presentation of the CV.
### Features
- **Personal Details Display**: Showcases personal information including a photo, name, last name, and current position.
- **Dynamic Experience & Education Listing**: Utilizes TypeScript interfaces to model the data structure and array mapping in JSX to dynamically render the experience and education sections of the CV.
### Project Structure
- **App.scss**: Contains the styles for the application.
- **App.tsx**: The main React component that renders the personal CV details, including personal information, experience, and education.
